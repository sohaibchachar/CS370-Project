# CS370-Project 
Milestone 5: The Professor said he wants two things from us in this milestone <br>
1. One or two videos with translated audio and translated subtitles embedded in the video. So I made a separate script for that. (link to that script) https://github.com/sohaibchachar/CS370-Project/blob/Milestone5/Milestone5%20(1).ipynb <br> The videos that I generated from that script can be found here  <br>(Video 1) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXT8YVNjVKJWXe4XSAweTtvyChhXGawh/view?usp=sharing <br>(Video 2)  https://drive.google.com/file/d/198EWuj-nvhHS3J1bTQqY35c-uJGJccp1/view?usp=sharing <br>
2. Huggingface UI. (Link for that) https://huggingface.co/spaces/sohaibchachar/EnToFrYoutubeVideoTranslator (when you test it please run it with the small videos like 2-3 minutes long because it takes forever for longer videos) <br>
